FORRT aims to collect and catalogue exemplary instances of principled education - i.e., successful pedagogies in teaching or mentoring of open and reproducible principles. FORRT pedagogies are detailed examples of the processes by which ideals in teaching, mentoring, and openness of these materials come to materialize.  

It is our hope that scholars, instructors, educational institutions aiming to develop or reform degree programs and courses can use FORRTâ€™s pedagogies as an initial template towards the creation of their personalized pedagogies. In this sense, the idea is to facilitate the initial costs of integrating field-specific education with open and reproducible science tenets. 

FORRT pedagogies might encompass reflections on increasing the dissemination, recognition and re-purposefulness of teaching practices and materials; experiences of adapting courses to incorporate reproducibility and transparency; perspectives on the social and ethical responsibilities towards teaching these principles.

It has been suggested that one potential solution to the replicability crisis is to make replication an explicit part of higher education pedagogy (Everett & Earp, 2015; Frank & Saxe, 2012; Grahe et al., 2012; Hawkins et al., 2018; King et al., 2016; LeBel, 2015; Standing, 2016). So, in addition to formal teaching of courses on replications (Janz, 2015; Le, 2020; Orben, 2019, Srivastava, 2016), mentorship offers an important avenue into the dissemination of open and reproducible research principles. One strong example of principled mentoring is a consortia approach (Button et al., 2018) in which students collaborate on an overarching project (while still ensuring sufficient independence). Importantly, students are mentored through a research process that maps more effectively to best practices; studies are typically pre-registered, they are sufficiently statistically powered to address the core research questions, and open research practices are followed throughout. Similarly, individual courses can be leveraged to mentor students through open and reproducible practices. For instance, the Collaborative Replications and Education Project (CREP; Grahe et al. 2018) offers students with training opportunities to conduct large-scale collaborative replication research projects, and training and support for teachers wishing to guide their students through these projects. 

Thus, principled education can leverage the aforementioned ideals to teach and train students (open to all students, not only those pursuing a career in academia) the procedures of science and its intricacies along with hands-on-approach to relevant concepts (such as reproducibility, replication, pre-registration, analytical flexibility, etc.), involving tasks addressing the broad range of skills that they will need as professionals, such as understanding and communicating data insights (collect it or perform experiments), precise and complete record keeping, accurate reporting of results, and a commitment to oral and written presentations and publication.

Hence, we are also collecting submission of exemplary instances of principled education which might include: reflections on increasing the dissemination, recognition and re-purposefulness of teaching practices and materials; experiences of adapting courses to incorporate reproducibility and transparency; perspectives on the social and ethical responsibilities towards teaching these principles.
