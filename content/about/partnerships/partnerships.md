<img src="UKRN.png" align="right" /> [The UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN)](https://www.ukrn.org/) is a national peer-led consortium that aims to ensure the UK retains its place as a centre for world-leading research. We do this by investigating the factors that contribute to robust research, promoting training activities, and disseminating best practice. UKRN also works collaboratively with various external stakeholders to ensure coordination of efforts across the sector. UKRN seeks to understand the factors that contribute to poor research reproducibility and replicability, and develop approaches to counter these, in order to improve the trustworthiness and quality of research. These issues affect all disciplines, so we aim for broad disciplinary representation.

<img src="ProjectTier.png" align="right" /> [Project TIER](https://www.projecttier.org) promotes the integration of principles of transparency and reproducibility in the quantitative methods training of undergraduate and graduate students. Project TIER is guided by the vision that students should be taught to use reproducible methods whenever they work with statistical data.  Reproducibility should be integrated into introductory courses in statistics or data analysis, reinforced at all levels of the quantitative methods curriculum, and ultimately adopted by students when they conduct research for theses, dissertations, or other independent projects. To pursue this vision, Project TIER's strategy is to focus on supporting instructors who wish to incorporate transparency and reproducibility in their teaching and research supervision. The primary activities include developing standards and curriculum for reproducible research, and then disseminating those resources to instructors via the TIER website, conferences and symposia, and faculty development workshops.

<img src="RN_German.png" align="right" /> [The German Reproducibility Network (GRN)](https://reproducibilitynetwork.de/) is a cross-disciplinary consortium that aims to increase trustworthiness and transparency of scientific research by investigating and encouraging the factors that contribute to robust research. We promote training activities and disseminate best practices, conduct and support meta-scientific research, and work with stakeholders to ensure coordination of efforts. GRN’s activities span multiple levels, including researchers, institutions and other stakeholders (e.g., funders, publishers, and Academic Societies).

<img src="ReplicationWiki.jpg" align="right" /> [The ReplicationWiki ](https://replication.uni-goettingen.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) serves as a database of empirical studies in the social sciences. It informs about the availability of replication material for them and categorizes them by keywords, methods used, sources, type and geographic origin of data used, and by software used. It lists replication studies and their types and results as well as corrections and retractions. More than 4,600 studies are already listed as well as over 700 replications. The database helps social scientists to see which results have already been tested independently and how replications are published. For instructors it helps to easily identify practical examples, e.g., that for which a method was used that they want to teach and for which data and code are available in a software they can use with their students.

<img src="PAPORTRAIL.png" align="right" /> [PaPOR TRaIL](https://open.ucc.ie/browse/all/cpd/courses/papor-trail-principles-and-practices-of-open-research-003cpd) is a free course on open research for undergraduate and postgraduate students. It is a self-paced online course that students can take independently and/or that can be embedded in exiting research curricula. Students can first complete an introductory module that providing a comprehensive understanding of the principles and practices of open research.  Following completion of this module, students can choose to complete any/all of six skill-based sections that demonstrate how to do the following open research practices. The six skills-based modules include: research integrity; pre-registration; research data management; reproducible practices; open reporting; open knowledge dissemination.

**Project Summaries** [(link)](/summaries/)

<br>

<img src="rtea_bordeaux.png" align="right" /> [The BordeauxTea](https://osf.io/jqxw6/) is a journal club organized in monthly sessions in which students and young researchers discuss various topics related to Open Science around a warm cup of tea. It is based in Bordeaux (France), and part of the Neurocampus Graduate Program PhD training (Université de Bordeaux). Moreover, the BordeauxTea stems from the ReproducibiliTea initiative—a worldwide Open Science initiative spread to more than 138 institutions in 26 countries.

## **Cooperation & Collaborations**

__*Meta-psychology special issue*__

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have partnered with the journal [Meta-Psychology](https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology) and the [Psychological Science Accelerator](https://psysciacc.org/) to work on a recurring special issue. The call will request teaching materials, including pedagogical considerations, for the Educational NEXUS. This also sets the stage for our vision of academia in which the creation and maintenance of teaching resources are more valued - changing the publication’s structure to include these excellent and open resources.

__*Center for Open Science - OSKB & COSGN*__

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are partnering up with [OSKB](https://cos.io/oskb) ([Open Science Knowledge Base](https://cos.io/oskb)) to coordinate the alignment of our meta-data on educational materials so that we share our resources and community. To that end, FORRT will have a community in OSKB’s home ([OER Commons](https://www.oercommons.org/)) and enrich data and reduced redundant work. FORRT also joined COS network-of-networks or [Community of Open Scholarship Grassroots Networks](https://groups.google.com/a/cos.io/forum/#!topic/network-of-open-science-grassroots-networks/1OWtx9VDSwo) ([COSGN](https://groups.google.com/a/cos.io/forum/#!topic/network-of-open-science-grassroots-networks/1OWtx9VDSwo)). These partnerships aim to help build a community of existing educational initiatives, strengthening our missions, and streamline the advancement of open and reproducible educational practices.
